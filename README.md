# Introduction to Shell Scripting

Welcome to the **Introduction to Shell Scripting** repository! This project is designed to introduce shell scripting for automating tasks in Unix/Linux environments. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic command-line operations to more advanced shell script development.

## 🧑‍💻 Overview

Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, manage systems, and interact with Unix/Linux operating systems. It combines the simplicity of command-line utilities with the flexibility of programming logic, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and perform complex operations with minimal manual intervention.

This repository contains examples of shell scripts that demonstrate key concepts such as process management, file handling, task automation, and system monitoring.

## ✨ Features

This repository includes practical shell scripting examples that demonstrate:

- **Basic Shell Commands**: Common commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`.
- **Variables and Parameters**: Using variables and accepting parameters in shell scripts.
- **Control Structures**: Conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and loops such as `for`, `while`, and `until`.
- **File Handling**: Working with files and directories, reading and writing data, and checking file statuses.
- **Process Management**: Handling background and foreground processes, and using `ps`, `kill`, and `jobs`.
- **Text Processing**: Using `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and `cut` to process text data efficiently.
- **Task Scheduling**: Automating tasks using `cron` and `at`.
- **System Monitoring**: Scripts to monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporating error handling and debugging techniques in shell scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have access to a Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.) and a shell environment like `bash`, `sh`, or `zsh`. You can check your shell version by running:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```
